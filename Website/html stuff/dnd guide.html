        D&D is truly a fun game although it does require time to learn. all you
        need is a set of dice, a copy of the rule and well ... your imagination.

        <strong>Dice</strong>

        
        You have probably seen thoes wierd dice, those are called RPG dice 
        and they are used to play RPG games. Lets have a look at the common ones.

        the 20 sided dice more know as d20. it is the most used dice. this dice is usually 
        used for ability checks, saving throws, who gets to attack first, who gets to miss
        and who is going to hit

        the 12 sided dice more known as d12, the d12 is often used in battles as some weapons
        used the d12 to calculate their damage. some spells use d12 to calculate their damage
        too

        the 6 sided dice more known as d6, much like the d12 the d6 is also used to calculate
        damage for weapons and spells.

        there are more dice that i didn't mention such as the d8, d10 and the d4 all of them 
        are primarily used for damage.
